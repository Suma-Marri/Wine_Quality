# Wine Quality

## Project Overview

#### Selected topic: Wine Quality Prediction

Here we will predict the quality of wine on the basis of giving features. We are using the wine quality dataset from Kaggle. This dataset has the fundamental features which are responsible for affecting the quality of the wine. By the use of several Machine learning models, we will predict the quality of the wine.

#### Reason why we selected this topic: 

We had a similar interest in wine.

#### Description of the source of data: 

We found a dataset to start with that have multiple features for diffrent kinds of wines, such as pH and density.

Dataset description: These are the name of Features from the dataset

1. fixed acidity
2. volatile acidity
3. citric acid
4. residual sugar
5. chlorides
6. free sulfur dioxide
7. total sulfur dioxide
8. density
9. pH
10. sulphates
11. alcohol
12. quality (score between 0 and 10)

#### Questions that we hope to answer with the data: 

We hope to find out what makes certain wines have a higher quality than others. 

####  Description of the communication protocols

The group keep discussing the project detailes during live sessions and constantly making contact with each other through the slack app, including sharing of information and data that we find online.
